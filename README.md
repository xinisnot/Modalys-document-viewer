# About

IRCAM's Modalys is a very attractive tool. However, the documentation does not seem to be tailored for Max. Also, it may be difficult for a Modalys beginner to guess the classification of a given `mlys` object (e.g., `mlys.felt` seems like an Object, but is actually a Connection). 

This patch is useful for the following tasks on mlys objects:

- check Modalisp commands corresponding to mlys objects
- check Modalisp parameters corresponding to attributes possessed by mlys objects
- Access Modalys documentation and Max Help (if available)
