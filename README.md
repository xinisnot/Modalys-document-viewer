# About

IRCAM's Modalys is a very attractive tool. However, the documentation does not seem to be tailored for Max. Also, it may be difficult for a Modalys beginner to guess the classification of a given `mlys` object (e.g., `mlys.felt` seems like an Object, but is actually a Connection). This patch previews the official documentation associated with the selected `mlys` object.
