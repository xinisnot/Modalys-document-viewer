# About

IRCAM's Modalys is a very attractive tool. However, the documentation does not seem to be tailored for Max. Also, it may be difficult for a Modalys beginner to guess the classification of a given `mlys` object (e.g., `mlys.felt` seems like an Object, but is actually a Connection). 

This patch allows you to see the title and description of the selected `mlys` object on the official documentation. If you want to see more details, you can access the official documentation by pressing the "more..." button (this will launch your browser).
